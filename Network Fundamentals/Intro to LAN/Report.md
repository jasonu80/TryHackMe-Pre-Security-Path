## Hands-on Labs walkthrough

This walkthrough shows the knowledge on how to break a LAN network based on the type of topology it has. Here are what I thought on what are the different types of LAN topologies and their weaknesses:

The ring topology works on transferring packets of data through devices in a connected cable loop. One of the crucial weaknesses is that the data will not transfer from one device to the other when the connection is down. 

The bus topology works on connecting multiple devices in the form of a backbone. One of the drawbacks of this topology is when one of the devices sent too much data on the backbone network, the entire network will be unable to operate due to handling too much data in the network itself. 

The star topology works on connecting multiple devices into a single switch to communicate within each other. One of the downsides of this topology is the devices connected are dependent on a single switch itself. When the switch is broken or not operating, then devices cannot communicate within each other to send packets of data. 

## Organisational Impact

It is important for businesses to understand how different LAN topologies work in different purposes. When a single computer in the office is broken, then other employees may or may not be able to communicate within each other depending on the type of topologies that the company is utilising. For instance, if a company utilises a bus topology, then it solves one of the many concerns that businesses solve as a this topology depends on the amount of data sent across the network. Therefore, it is essential for businesses or organisations to understand different variaties of LAN topologies to setup a computer network.

## Skills Analysis

This requires me to develop these skills:
1. Written Communication - Document my learning journey within my own words and understanding.
2. Problem Solving - Provide solutions on a certain scenario that a company may face.
