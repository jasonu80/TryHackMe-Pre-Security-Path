## Concepts

This room deeps dive into the detailed structure from Pre-Security path. 

## Concepts

#### OSI Layer: Detailed

There are 7 layers of the OSI model and here are the detailed breakdown on how each layer perform their duties:

Layer 1 - Physical Layer -> The layer where a physical connection is connected to a device.

Layer 2 - Data Link layer -> The layer where data transfers are occurred within a number of devices in the **same** network.

Layer 3 - Network Layer -> The layer where data transfers are occured in a **different** network within a number of devices.

Layer 4 - Transport Layer -> Perform an end-to-end communication between running apps on different hosts.

Layer 5 - Session Layer -> Establishes/Starts the communication between 2 different hosts.

Layer 6 - Presentation Layer -> Deliver data that layer 7 will understand, by encoding and decoding it.

Layer 7 - Application Layer -> Provide services to applications that is directly seen by the end user.

#### TCP/IP Model

Similar like the OSI Layer, this layer provides a shorter layer:

4 layer version: 

Layer 1 - Link Layer -- maps to Layer 1 and 2 OSI layer

Layer 2 - Internet Layer -- maps to Layer 3 OSI layer

Layer 3 - Transport Layer -- maps to Layer 4 OSI layer

Layer 4 - Application Layer -- maps to Layer 5 to 7 OSI layer

5 layer version, according to Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach 8th Edition, Kurose and Ross:

Layer 1 - Physical Layer -- maps to Layer 1 OSI layer

Layer 2 - Link Layer -- maps to Layer 2 OSI layer

Layer 3 - Internet Layer -- maps to Layer 3 OSI layer

Layer 4 - Transport Layer -- maps to Layer 4 OSI layer

Layer 5 - Application Layer -- maps to Layer 5 to 7 OSI layer

#### IP Addresses and subnets

IP (Internet Protocol) address is a computer-based identity that is unique which is utilised to identify itself in a public and private network. 

IP address can be broken into 4 2^8 digits separated with a dot `.`, which is called octet. Example include: `192.168.0.1`.

A network has an address from `192.168.0.1` - `192.168.0.254`, 2 IP addresses are reserved which ends with 0 (Broadcast address) and 255 (Network address).

There are 2 types of IP address:

1. Public IP address - able to be viewed via the internet or public network.
2. Private IP address - able to be viewed by the terminal, which cannot be accessed by public.

There are 3 defined addresses for an IP that is private, according to RFC 1918:

1. `10/8`
2. `172.16/12`
3. `192.168/16`

The slashes are also known as subnets, which means that the first 8 bits of the network would not change, and the rest of the bits are changed.

#### UDP & TCP

#### Encapsulation

## Hands-on Lab: Telnet

### What is Telnet? 

Telnet or Teletype Network is a network protocol that is utilised to communicate and connect with a remote system. It also allows the user to issue text commands. 

Here are the commands that I ran on TryHackMe's lab machine:

```bash
# telnet <IP Address> <Port number>

telnet 10.49.128.242 7

# Port 7 is utilised for testing if the server responded using text.

# Output:

#Trying 10.49.128.242...
#Connected to 10.49.128.242.
#Escape character is '^]'.
#Hi
#Hi
#Hello
#Hello
#How are you?
#How are you?
#Bye :)
#Bye :)
#^]
#telnet> quit
#Connection closed.
