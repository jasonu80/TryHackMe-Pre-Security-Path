# Tools 3: telnet (deep dive into this one)

# Task 1: Retrieve the file flag.html using telnet. 

# Process:

# 1. Connect to telnet using HTTP protocol, which is at port 80.
telnet <IP_Target> 80

#2. Then, specify the HTTP method and destination alongside with HTTP version, once logged in to telnet.

GET /flag.html HTTP/1.1
Host: anything 

# Enter twice, then it gets the output.

# Task 2: Retrieve flag.txt using ftp protocol. 

# We know that FTP runs on port 21. Using the command ftp that is already installed in the Linux machine, the client is directly connected to the machine via ftp.

# Then, we need to provide the username and password if needed. 

# After that, list the files inside the ftp protocol and retrieve the file to the client system by using the command `get`. 

# Here is the process:

ftp <IP Address>

#Connected to <IP Address>.
#220 (vsFTPd 3.0.5)
#Name (<IP Address>:root): anonymous
#331 Please specify the password.
#Password: # No password is provided, so enter to proceed.
#230 Login successful.
#Remote system type is UNIX.
#Using binary mode to transfer files.
#ftp> ls
#200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
#150 Here comes the directory listing.

#150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for flag.txt (14 bytes).
#226 Transfer complete.

# Task 3: Connect to POP3 and retrieve the flag with the username and password. (Username: Admin, Password: @dm1nistr@t0r12345!)

# There are no tools that are available for viewing messages in Linux distribution, so it uses telnet to connect to POP3 protocol.

# The first thing is to connect to POP3 protocol using telnet by specifying the target of the IP address provided and the port that is running.

# Then, Provide the username first then enter the password afterwards. 

# The command STAT provides the information about how many mails are available inside of the inbox of a specific user. In this case, it is 4 mails.

# RETR means to retrieve, which is to fetch any mail number that is less than the number of mail that is provided on the STAT command. In this case, it is 4.

# QUIT means to logout from the server and continue on the current shell that is running.
