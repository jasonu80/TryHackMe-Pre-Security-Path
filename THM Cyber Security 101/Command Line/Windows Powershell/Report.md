## Hands-on lab description and impacts

This lab covers in-depth about the powershell command line that works for Windows Operating System. It covers about the syntax of the language, the basic commands that it has listed, and the applications in the cyber security industry. This command line is popular for IT professionals and Cyber Security workers as this language is popular for attackers to gain entry into the system. The impact that I gain on this room is to create a script or command that is able to break into the system based on the vulnerabilities present because it helps the industry to determine the vulnerabilities that are present and the mitigations that will be implemented.
