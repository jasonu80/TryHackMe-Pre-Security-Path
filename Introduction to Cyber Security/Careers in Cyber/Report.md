## Underlying Concepts

In the room provided by TryHackMe, there are a plenty of job roles that are focused on Cyber Security, ranging from offensive to defensive security. On the list below, there are numerous career options that are available in Cyber Security, listed below:
1. Security Analyst - Explore and evaluate the network of a company to uncover any data that is malicious and provide recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures. This job role require attention to detail and strong analytical skills, as it is a type of career that handles a number of logs in a computer system and able to analyse which are the ones that are malicious in the system.
2. Security Engineer - Develop and implement security products using threats and vulnerability data, which is gathered from the Security Analyst from the process of logging vulnerabilities in a computer system. This role requires problem solving as it is the role that builds a security product to mitigate any risk involved in a computer system. 
3. Incident Responder - Identify and mitigate any cyber attacks inside a computer system or application. This role requires the ability of strategic thinking, time management, and organisation as if there was a cyber attack happened inside the company, they will actively respond and mitigate to that attack in the shortest time possible. 
4. Digital Forensics Examiner - Investigate incidents and crimes inside of a computer system or application. This role requires strong analytical and written communication skills, as it will be handling a numerous of files that are harmless and harmful in a system and document the findings inside to fill it inside the report.
5. Malware Analyst - Analyse all types of malware on how and what they do inside of a computer system. This role requires a skill of decision making and the ability to read programming language, as it help malware analysts to understand how the malware works in the static analysis and decide if it is a malicious file that is conducted in the dynamic analysis.
6. Penetration Tester - Responsible for testing technology products to find any vulnerabilities. This term is the same with ethical hacking. One of the crucial skill of this role is the ability to think outside the box and the ability to perform a written as well as spoken communication skills. The reason is that security products come in various styles, based on the designs, logic, structured, and many more. After performing the testing, the tester requires the ability to report any vulnerabilities using a general and simple language, as the report will be read by the stakeholders.
7. Red Teamer - Plays the role of a threat actor, attacking the organisation and provide feedback from the perspective of the enemy. This role is the next level of penetration testing, which is performing an attack inside the organisation itself to help the company improve their security measures.

 ## My thoughts about this room

Honestly, there is no hands-on lab for this room. It focuses mostly on what are the job opportunities available in the cyber security market. Interestingly, there is a quiz that helps me determine which role that I should take to specialise in the Cyber Security market. The link will be provided on this [text](https://static-labs.tryhackme.cloud/sites/careers-quiz/). After I tried answering the questions on the link provided, in addition, I may suitable to become a **Penetration Tester** as I may have the ability to think like an attacker itself. Here is the proof:

On the last few words in the Quiz section, there is a blog provided by the team. The title is "How to Leverage Online Training to Achieve High Paying Careers". Reading the title, I am assuming that it teaches the user on how to integrate an online training platform, like TryHackMe, to achieve a career that you want to become. There are several steps that I thought it would be interesting to discuss:
1. Filter down your ultimate goal
  Yes, goal is important, but without system, goal would be impossible to achieve and it feels daunting to achieve it. After performing the cyber career quiz, it would be important to set systems instead of goals, because it will create a habit loop that you will achieve your goals.
2. Set a plan for Online Training
  Understanding your "WHY" you are choosing an online platform is crucial before you start. It is important to research the learning platform, the price, as well as its contents. TryHackMe is one of the best platforms that include both hands-on labs and challenges to be able to utilise them in the real world industry.
3. Certifications!
  This is the my favourite ones, and maybe the others as well. Certifications just prove that you have the skills that the company need, but how do you prove that you have the skills listed on the certification itself? Creating journals after every learning is crucial for every room, even though it is simple, at least you have the evidence that you experienced using this tool.
4. CV and Interviews
  It highlights your enthusiasm in the field that you are currently focusing at. One of the blog posts mentions that: "Provide details such as the topics covered, duration of study, and details of your learning." This is important as it shows you to the hiring managers that you have the ability to understand and apply your knowledge in hands-on labs gained with theoretical knowledge.
